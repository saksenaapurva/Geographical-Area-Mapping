# Geographical-Area-Mapping
Geographical Area Mapping and Classification Utilizing Multispectral Satellite Imagery Processing Based on Machine Learning Algorithms Classifying Land based on its use for different purposes 

Classified satellite images into categories in which they are suitable for- agricultural, commercial, industrial etc. using Image Processing and Machine Learning algorithms.

The goal of this system is to obtain the land-use map which highlights the areas suited to the usersâ€™ requirements. This makes construction easier. 
For example, a user can now use the commercial regions specified in the land-use map for construction of commercial offices.

A satellite image is taken as input in the ArcGIS software and image classification is done using the NDVI index.
The model is trained by taking a sample of satellite images
The model is then tested against the remaining satellite images to obtain the "Land Use" Map

The Land Use Map is the final output which has been categorized into areas depending on the NDVI Index

Hence,

Green denotes good for agriculture
Red denotes not suitable for agriculture
Yellow denotes commercial use

After obtaining the Land Use map we can say that a particular area is suitable for either agriculture or commercial use
